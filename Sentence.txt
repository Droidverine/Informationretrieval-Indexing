Doc1	this is the first of five documents
Doc2	Each of the documents will be on a single line. the document title is separated by a TAB character
Doc3	Why? well, just a space would be confusing with the rest of the whitespace in the documents. Tabs are easier.
Doc4	You do need to look out for carriage returns though. some languages allow for "line" as an entity
Doc5	Other languages will insist on a block of text delineated by carriage return statements!!!
